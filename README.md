# Support for this repository has been discontinued. Since there is a brand new version that works automatically and gives you license keys instead of accounts. You can find this version [HERE](https://github.com/rzc0d3r/ESET-KeyGen)

# ESET-License-Generator
ESET License Generator - Generates accounts to activate the trial period

# How to use

0. Download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/ru/chrome/) and his [Stable Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/). 

NOTE: If your version of chrome is for example 102.2.3.004 then you need to download a driver
      with the same version (Only the first 3 digits are taken into account, for example 102)

The driver must be unpacked and moved to the folder with main.py.

Next, install the Python libraries, in cmd or powershell:

```
pip install selenium requests
```

1. Next, you need to edit main.py to suit your needs.
SIZE - a number (int) indicating how many accounts to create
OUTPUT - text (str) indicating where to write the data of the created accounts
SLEEP - number (int) indicating the delay between operations in seconds

2. Run main.py and wait until Press Enter...
After that, you will see a file with accounts in OUTPUT

5. (NEW METHOD). Open the eset_license_web.py file and enter the email and password for your ESET account that you entered in step 4.

Then continue as in step 5 (Remove all licenses).

eset_license_web.py file will automatically open the license page!

# Recommendations and information

1. SLEEP delay is better to choose within 1 min if you need 12 accounts

2. Do not create many accounts in a short period of time, otherwise you will be blocked in ESET HOME for a certain period of time

3. You can skip step 2 if you have already created an account in this program

4. You can run eset_license_generator_auto.py if you need to create 1 account. The credentials will be in the console (Not saved to a file!!!)

5. ONE ACCOUNT = ONE LICENSE !!!
